A one-page write-up, in PDF form, detailing any challenges you experienced and how you dealt with them.

1. A basic understanding of argument parser 
Instead of having to manually set variables inside of the code, argparse can be used to code. In this homework, I learned argparse module can be used to add flexibility and reusability of code by allowing user input value to be parsed and utilized.

2. In "write_tags" function:
The logic should be reversed comepare to "read_tags" function so I used " ".join(tags) + '\n'.
I also used writelines() at the end of for loop because writing data just once is ideal. 

3. Other minor problems: 
Since I am not familiar with Linux OS, I searched Window OS command line executor in google.
